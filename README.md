# Gorilla Dynamics

Gorilla Dynamics is a Windows-only application (at the moment) that allows users to effortlessly copy files from a USB or hard drive to a specified destination on their desktop. The application is designed to be user-friendly with a straightforward interface, featuring two main pages: the Agreement Page and the Menu Page. From the Menu Page, users can navigate to other parts of the app such as Gorilla Hoover, Converter, Features, Help, and Check for Updates.
